## Weekly Challenge - 1
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Introduction
 
 In this weeks challenge I used the skills I learned in module one to improve the legiblity of the given starter code. I also made sure all alt tags paired and functioning properly. With my skills with CSS I move code around to allign better with HTML, as well as making the code more legible by consolidating and organizing CSS selectors and proporties. I was unsure if I submited the correct live URl. The link submited under "Live URl" links to the website weve been working on for the challenge, I hope that is correct.
